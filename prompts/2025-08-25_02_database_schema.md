Goal: Generate the initial PostgreSQL schema for the products and user roles.
Prompt (trimmed): "Act as a senior DBA. Create a full PostgreSQL schema for an inventory app. It needs user profiles with roles, a products table with a unique SKU, and robust data integrity features like automatic version incrementing on update via triggers and RLS policies to prevent staff from editing prices."
AI Output (trimmed): The AI generated a comprehensive schema including a trigger function (update_updated_at_column) to automatically increment the version on every UPDATE, and a restrictive RLS policy that blocked any update where a staff member changed the unit_price.
My Acceptance/Changes (2â€“5 lines):
Accepted: The core tables (profiles, products) and the general use of Row Level Security.
Rejected: The automatic version-increment trigger. This conflicted with the explicit optimistic concurrency pattern, which requires the application to control the version check.
Removed: The RLS policy for unit_price edits. This policy would cause a generic database error, preventing me from implementing the specific "Tripwire" requirement, which needs the application server to catch the attempt and trigger a specific UI modal.
