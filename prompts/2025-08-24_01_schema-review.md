Goal: Validate and improve the initial Supabase PostgreSQL schema.
Prompt (trimmed):
"Here is my proposed schema for a Supabase project, which uses a profiles table linked to auth.users. Can you review this and propose an alternative or improved version? The goal is a robust schema for a standard inventory management application."
AI Output (trimmed):
"An alternative approach is a self-contained schema:
code
SQL
-- Create users table
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  email TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  password TEXT NOT NULL, -- Hashed password
  role TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'staff'
);
-- Create products table...
This decouples you from a specific auth provider."
My Acceptance/Changes (2–5 lines):
Rejected: The AI's suggestion to create a custom users table is fundamentally wrong for a Supabase project. It ignores Supabase's built-in, secure authentication, forcing a manual and insecure implementation of user management.
Accepted: I maintained my original schema design. It correctly leverages the platform's features by linking a profiles table to auth.users, which is the official best practice for security and efficiency.Timestamp: 2025-08-26 05:30 UTC
