Goal: Create a Mermaid diagram to visualize the system architecture.
Prompt (trimmed): "Generate a Mermaid architecture diagram for my application, which has a Next.js frontend, a separate Node.js backend, and uses Supabase for the database and auth. The whole system is deployed on Vercel."
AI Output (trimmed): The AI produced a diagram focused on the physical deployment infrastructure, with boxes for the "Vercel Cloud" containing the frontend and backend services.
My Acceptance/Changes (2â€“5 lines):
Accepted: The basic components of the system.
Refined: The entire focus of the diagram. I rejected the deployment-centric view in favor of a logical data flow diagram, which better explains how data moves through the system.
Added: Explicit labels for both "Owner" and "Staff" user roles, and highlighted the specific system layers (Node.js API and Database RLS) where their different permissions are enforced.
