Goal: Define the high-level project repository structure.
Prompt (trimmed): "Based on the project brief for a full-stack inventory app, what is the most efficient project structure for a Next.js frontend and a Node.js backend using Supabase?"
AI Output (trimmed): "For maximum development velocity and simplified deployment, you should use a unified Next.js application. The backend can be built using Next.js API Routes within the same project. This avoids CORS issues and the complexity of managing two separate services."
My Acceptance/Changes (2â€“5 lines):
Rejected: The AI's advice to use a unified Next.js repo was a misinterpretation. The project brief explicitly lists "Node.js (Express, Nest)" as a backend option, signaling that the ability to build and manage a decoupled architecture is a key evaluation criterion.
Corrected: I adopted a monorepo structure with two distinct packages: frontend-nextjs and backend-node. This accurately matches the prompt's requirements and allows for a clear separation of concerns as intended by the challenge.
