Goal: Decompose the project brief into a strategic plan, tech stack, and git commit strategy.
Prompt (trimmed):
"Act as a senior tech lead. Based on the attached project brief, propose a high-level project plan. Recommend a full tech stack (frontend, backend, DB, deployment) optimized for rapid development and easy deployment. Also, outline a staged git commit strategy that aligns with the project's functional requirements."
AI Output (trimmed):
"Tech Stack: Next.js with TypeScript, Next.js API Routes for backend, PostgreSQL on Supabase for DB/Auth, and Vercel for deployment.
Justification: This stack is a monorepo, simplifying development and deployment. Supabase handles auth and DB boilerplate.
Git Strategy:
feat: initial project scaffolding
feat: implement authentication..."
My Acceptance/Changes (2â€“5 lines):
Rejected: The suggestion to use Next.js API Routes for the backend.
Added: I opted for a separate Node.js (Express/FastAPI) backend to maintain a clear separation of concerns between the frontend client and the server API. This also simplifies the generation of OpenAPI documentation as required by the brief.
Accepted: The overall staged git commit strategy as a roadmap, and the use of Next.js for the frontend and Supabase for the database.
Added: I will use Shadcn/ui with Tailwind CSS for rapid and accessible UI development.
