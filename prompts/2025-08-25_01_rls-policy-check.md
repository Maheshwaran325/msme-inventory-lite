Goal: Verify if a Supabase RLS policy correctly prevents staff from editing a specific field.
Prompt (trimmed):
"Will this Supabase RLS policy correctly prevent users with the 'staff' role from updating the unit_price column on the products table? If not, why?

CREATE POLICY "Staff can update non-price fields."
  ON products FOR UPDATE TO authenticated
  USING ((SELECT role FROM profiles WHERE id = auth.uid()) = 'staff')
  WITH CHECK (unit_price = unit_price);
"

AI Output (trimmed):
"No, this will not work as intended. In an `UPDATE` policy's `WITH CHECK` clause, `unit_price` refers to the new value being submitted. The condition `unit_price = unit_price` will therefore always be true. The primary enforcement for this 'tripwire' logic must be implemented in your server-side API code."

My Acceptance/Changes (2â€“5 lines)
Accepted The AI's analysis was spot-on. It correctly identified that RLS was the wrong tool for this specific requirement and that the check was logically flawed.
Added: Based on this, I confirmed my plan to implement the "tripwire" logic explicitly in my Next.js API route. I will keep the simpler RLS policy as a secondary defense layer.
